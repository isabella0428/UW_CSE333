// This class is useful when you are exploring the behavior of STL
// containers.  The class gives each instance that is manufactured
// using the default constructor a unique ID and a current value.  The
// current value is initialized to be the unique ID.
//
// Whenever an object is manufactured using the copy constructor, its
// value is copied from the argument.  Similarly, whenever an object
// is the target of an assignment operator, then its value is copied
// from the source.
//
// Finally, objects print messages out whenever important events
// happen, including default construction, copy construction,
// destruction, assignment, and "less than" operator invocation.
// (Less than is used as a comparator for things like sorting or
// inserting into the right sorted spot in a map.)
